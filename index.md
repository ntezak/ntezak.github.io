## Professional Interests

My PhD work at Stanford under [Hideo Mabuchi](https://mabuchilab.org) covered modeling techniques and applications for quantum feedback networks.

At [Rigetti Computing](https://rigetti.com) I worked on the full stack (hardware and software) for developing, operating and programming quantum computers.

Since joining [OpenAI](https://openai.com), I have picked up Deep (Reinforcement) Learning for the purpose of developing safe, general purpose artificial intelligence.
