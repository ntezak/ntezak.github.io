# Nik Tezak

I am a researcher and engineer interested in novel paradigms for information processing and building and operating large scale distributed systems.

Originally born in Germany, I studied Physics at [Heidelberg University](https://www.heidelberg.edu/) and afterwards obtained a PhD in Applied Physics from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/).

I currently live in Boulder, CO with my wife, kids and two cats.

## Professional Interests

At [OpenAI](https://openai.com), I have worked on a range of different projects and problems: [Deep RL for robotics](https://openai.com/research/solving-rubiks-cube), helping build the first version of our [API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) inference stack, and creating our current LLM training stack as well as training of the original [GPT-3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) and [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4).

At [Rigetti Computing](https://rigetti.com) I worked on the full stack (hardware and software) for developing, characterizing, and operating quantum computers.

My PhD work at Stanford under [Hideo Mabuchi](https://mabuchilab.org) covered modeling techniques and applications for quantum feedback networks.
